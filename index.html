        <p>Sweets Bakery was established in 1965 and has become a local favorite for the past 40 years. Our commitment to providing 
            quality products as well as our excellent cutomer service have helped us stand uot to our customers. 
            We started our small business by selling babka to our friends and neighbors from our home kitchen. Soon enough, 
            we opened the doors to our small bakery to the local community. When our buisness began to grow, we realized that we had so 
            much more to offer to the community that had opened their hearts and homes to our family. We began to sell pastries from some
            of our most treasured family recipes and we have become a staple for our local community and visitors alike. We hope
            you stop by soon!
